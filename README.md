# 100DayCodingChallenge
i hello...

In this coding 100 days challenge, we aim to practice coding questions as well as build up our development skills. So basically, we practice coding questions just like regular people do, to make it more fun, we intend to bring all of the questions that we have done into a small application. It could be as simple as a console command line interaction, an Android app or web app, as long as we build something with the technologies available. By the end of this challenge, we will see how many questions that we have done and apps that we have created. So bring it own!
